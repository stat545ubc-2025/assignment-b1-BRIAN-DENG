# Assignment B-1: Making a Function in R 
by Brian Deng

Hello and welcome to my repository!

This repository contains files for Assignment B-1, as part of the STAT 545B class. For this assignment, I created a function that plots a magenta-coloured histogram. 

In this repository, you will find the following files/folders:
1. README.md
  - the file you are reading now, which provides an overview of the repository and how to engage with it
2. assignment-b1.Rmd
  - the source R markdown file that contains the code and text for Assignment B-1
3. assignment-b1.md
  - the knitted markdown file that shows all the code, text, and plots for Assignment B-1
4. assignment-b1_files/figure-markdown_strict
  - the folder that contains the plot images that are referenced in the knitted markdown file for Assignment B-1

To explore my work, either open the markdown files in Github to view a coherent knitted file, or open the R markdown file and run it in RStudio.
